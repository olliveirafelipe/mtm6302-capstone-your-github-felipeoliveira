This project will be a responsive web application called Pokedex, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It will use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch and display a dynamic gallery of Pokémon.

Features
- Display a list of Pokémon with images and names
- Load more Pokémon on user interaction
- View detailed information about a selected Pokémon
- Mark/unmark Pokémon as "caught" (stored locally)

This is Part 1 of the Capstone Project for MTM6302 - Web Development III.
