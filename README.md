## Prototype Report – Part 3

The static prototype was developed using HTML, CSS (Flex/Grid), and JavaScript. The layout closely follows the mockups created in Part 2, including both desktop and mobile versions.

Tools & Resources:
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) – for images
- Google Fonts – for typography
- CSS Grid & Flexbox – for responsive layout

Challenges:
- Matching the mobile vs desktop layouts required media queries
- Maintaining consistent spacing between cards while ensuring flexibility
- Choosing the right colors to reflect Pokémon types

All code is properly validated using [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), and follows proper indentation and formatting.
